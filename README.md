A proof of concept crypto virus to spread user awareness about attacks and implications of ransomwares. Phirautee is written purely using PowerShell and does not require any third-party libraries. This tool steals the information, holds an organisationâ€™s data to hostage for payments or permanently encrypts/deletes the organisation data.
